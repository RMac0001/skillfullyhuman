Next steps for extending the theme system

The guide is structured as standalone documentation and includes proper file paths, detailed code explanations, and practical examples. It emphasizes the specific requirements for Chakra UI 3.17 and how it differs from previous versions.

Section 02
I've created a comprehensive artifact covering "Section 2: Theme System Architecture Foundations" that builds on the initial Chakra UI 3.17 integration.
The artifact includes:

Theme Architecture Overview - A clear structure for organizing theme files and components
Base Theme Structure - Implementation of tokens, semantic tokens, and recipes using Chakra UI 3.17's createSystem
Theme Variations - Creation of default and dark themes that extend the base system
Theme Context and Provider - A context-based approach for theme switching with localStorage persistence
Theme Switch Component - A simple component for toggling between themes
Application Integration - Example code showing how to integrate with Next.js App Router
Extension Patterns - Guidelines for adding new themes and component recipes

The guide follows the modern Chakra UI 3.17 patterns using createSystem, defineTokens, defineSemanticTokens, and defineRecipe functions, ensuring compatibility with the latest version.
